                  <h4>A direct application of my skills.</h4>
                  <hr/>
                  <p>This academic year, I have the fantastic opportunity to complete a <i>Capstone Project</i> that completes the final requirement for my Informatics degree. These projects can be wide and varied, but I have/will be working with a team to directly make an impact with a small non-profit.</p>
                  <p>My project essentially will be to design, discuss, and implement technical systems for a Mexico-based non-profit named <b>Cromosoma</b>. This non-profit essentially helps small businesses in their area develop an online presence. Given the current times, this type of work is essentially to keeping local shops and businesses afloat.</p>
                  <p>Hence, my team and I will be working with Cromosoma to directly develop a system for collecting client information, storing that information, and automatically generating content (websites, marketing material, etc.) based off this information. The projct is still in development, but I am very excited to work a system that directly applies all of my skills.</p>

                  <h4>Teaching makes me smile.</h4>
                  <hr/>
                  <p>Choosing to become an <i>Undergraduate Instructor</i> at Indiana University was one of the best decisions I have made, which explains why it still is something I am involved in.
                  At IU, I help instruct an introductory course for informatics (i101). This class teaches anyone who is interested about informatics as a topic, big-idea technology concepts, and intro coding skills ranging from HTML to Python.</p>

                  <p>My responsibilities range from teaching lab sessions (usually coding lessons in various languages) to grading and monitoring student progress in the course.
                      More recently, due to COVID moving our classes online, I have even had opportunities to create material being taught in the class and give insights into what I believe students should learn.</p>

                <p>From an experiential standpoint, teaching has truly shown me how <b>awesome</b> it is to see students advance so quickly in technical skills in only a semester. Simultaneously, it is extremely rewarding to be able to see the progress of your teachings in the work around you.
                Ultimately, I would love to have a job that allows me to consistently see the great work that me and my team are doing. If you have more questions about teaching or would like a reference, <a class="red-text darken-4"href="contact.html">contact me</a>.</p>

                  <p>A recent project, that was unfortunately affected by COVID, was an opportunity I had to work with an Indiana University Alumni doing research for his company <a href="https://www.carebandremembers.com/">Careband</a>. Adam Sobol (CEO) worked With
                      IU to investigate his products (wearable devices for those with mental illnesses) as they were applied in rural homes rather than assisted-living centers, where they currently are deployed. </p>
                     <p>My experience here was gained as I interacted with participants, delved into the process of research (using the IRB and writing/recording documents), and communicated across team members to find more individuals to recruit into the project and obtain insights.</p>
                     <p>Unfortunately, COVID essentially shut this project now as we no longer could interact with participants, enter their homes to install hardware, or conduct other IU-related tasks. I was moved off-campus and since retired from the project to pursue other items.</p>

                  <p>My time at <i>Apple</i> is one of the, if not the top, best experiences I have had in my working history. Due to connections with Indiana University, the company had a great program setup for college students who wanted to get involved in their team. </p>
                  <p>My position title was <b>College At Home Advisor</b> and I essentially helped customers who called in with their technical issues. I had to problem solve, troubleshoot, and follow strict guidelines while also connected with each person I met. </p>
                  <p>Ultimately, the experience was less about the tasks and more related to the soft skills learned along with the experience with the company. Being able to be involved with such a large entity was both rewarding and eye-opening.</p>

                  <p>From strong communication and patience, to broad knowledge and problem solving, this position taught me the basis of soft skills and computer knowledge that Ultimately helped me choose the field I am in today </p>
                  <p>Best Buy was a fantastic opportunity to learn about sales and technology, but also to collaborate with a talented team and grow as a communicator to future potential clients or teams.</p>
